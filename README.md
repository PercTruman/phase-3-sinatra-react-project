   # Warhammer Army (Death Guard) Inventory App
This is a front-end applcation for an inventory app that can track 
all of the models that a user owns from a particular army.  This has been built for my personal  Death Guard army (from the Warhammer 40K universe), but could easily be expanded for any army of any tabletop wargame. The objective of this project is to demonstrate my skills acquired during phase 3 of The Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program.

## Requirements
* node v16.15.0
* npm v8.5.5


### How to use
Fork and clone
Run npm install
Run npm start
